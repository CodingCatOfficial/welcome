# CodingCatOfficial

Welcome to CodingCatOfficial! We are a team of five engineers dedicated to providing exclusive additional seasonal subscription services to [MurmurCats NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/murmurcats) holders.

## Our Origin

CodingCatOfficial originated from the MurmurCats Discord group, where five engineers initially volunteered to provide some open-source code. Our service began with spontaneous community support and gradually evolved into a more structured seasonal subscription model.

## Services and Products

Our services are specially designed for MurmurCats NFT holders. We do not release source code; instead, we provide executable files (.exe and .exec). Each season, we develop at least one to two applications, currently focusing on exchange operations such as arbitrage or automating complex tasks, to assist users in gaining market advantages.

## Subscription Conditions and Recommendations

- First, the threshold for joining the MurmurCats NFT community is relatively high, with the current NFT price around 1 ETH (subject to real-time changes). Please consider your asset allocation.
- After owning the NFT and joining the [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/murmurcats) for verification, this plan offers an additional seasonal subscription option for NFT holders. The subscription fee per season is 150U, which may be adjusted based on cooperative conditions with the project side.
- Of course, every principal amount is important. We recommend subscribing only when there is a confirmed known profit that can fully cover the subscription cost.

## Disclaimer

- Our applications are designed to provide operational advantages beyond those of average retail investors. However, actual results of operations, such as profits and losses, are not related to us.
- The program may encounter bugs due to network issues or unforeseen circumstances. We have made every effort to test and correct to avoid problems, but we still strongly recommend that users monitor their operations personally.

## Security Tips

- Since API keys and secrets are involved, please set these sensitive details on the IP whitelist and absolutely do not enable the withdrawal function.

## Contact Us
